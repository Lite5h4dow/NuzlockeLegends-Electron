# Electron-Express-Core
Electron app that uses Express to serve precompiled react

## Why?
i made this because im working on an app and didnt like the workflow of other electron app templates. so here is one with its own local server (i needed this for my usecase and though i would integrate it directly in to the app itself)

if people show interest in this, I'll document it properly and add stuff to it.
